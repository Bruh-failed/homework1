What is a remote repository?

It is the process of creating a copy of someone elseâ€™s project on different platforms like Git. The pros of this are that it allows you to change and modify the project without affecting the original project. It is used for recommending changes to someone else projects and allows it as a starting point for a new project. In git, the remote repository is a project folder public or private, and can be used for multiple reasons whether it's to save work or collaborate with other people.
